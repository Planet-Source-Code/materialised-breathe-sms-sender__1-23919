## Breathe SMS Sender


</div>

### Description

This is a SMS message sender, (SMS being Short Message Service.... I think) lol Anyway with it you can send text messages to any UK based cellular phone, Sorry folks but it uses breathes servers to send the message, so it is sadly UK only. I aint bothered what you do with the code to be honest, use it modify it, pass it off as your own, as long as you give me some votes :-)

You must have a valid Breathe login name and password to use this program.

Thanx
